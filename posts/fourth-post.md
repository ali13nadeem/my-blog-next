JavaScript (JS) and TypeScript (TS) are two of the most popular programming languages used for web development. While they share similarities, they also have key differences that affect how developers write code and build applications.

### JavaScript (JS)

JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted programming language that is widely used for adding interactivity to web pages. It is supported by all modern browsers and can be run on both the client-side and server-side (using environments like Node.js).

#### Key Features of JavaScript:
- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables can hold values of any type, which allows for flexibility but can also lead to runtime errors.
- **Prototypal Inheritance**: JavaScript uses a prototypal inheritance model, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions in JavaScript are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

### TypeScript (TS)

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It is designed to help developers catch errors early in the development process and improve the overall quality of the code.

#### Key Features of TypeScript:
- **Static Typing**: TypeScript allows developers to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values, helping to catch errors at compile time.
- **Enhanced Tooling**: TypeScript provides better tooling support in IDEs, such as autocompletion, type checking, and navigation.
- **ES6+ Features**: TypeScript supports modern JavaScript features (like async/await and destructuring) while also allowing developers to write code that is compatible with older JavaScript versions.

### Key Differences

1. **Typing**:
   - **JavaScript**: Dynamically typed.
   - **TypeScript**: Statically typed with type annotations.

2. **Compilation**:
   - **JavaScript**: Interpreted at runtime.
   - **TypeScript**: Compiled to JavaScript before execution.

3. **Learning Curve**:
   - **JavaScript**: Easier to start with for beginners.
   - **TypeScript**: Requires an understanding of types and may have a steeper learning curve for some developers.

### Conclusion

Choosing between JavaScript and TypeScript often depends on the project requirements and team preferences. TypeScript can be particularly beneficial for larger codebases or teams looking for better maintainability and error handling. However, JavaScript remains a versatile and powerful language for web development.
