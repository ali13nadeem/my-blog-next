Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables developers to build fast, user-friendly web applications with minimal effort. It offers features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and incremental static regeneration, which help enhance performance and improve SEO.

### Key Features of Next.js

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**:
   - Next.js allows pages to be rendered on the server for each request, providing users with faster initial load times and better SEO.

2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**:
   - With SSG, developers can pre-render pages at build time, creating static HTML that can be served to users quickly.

3. **API Routes**:
   - Next.js supports building API endpoints directly within the application, making it easy to create serverless functions.

4. **Dynamic Routing**:
   - It allows for dynamic routing based on file names, making it straightforward to create routes for your application.

5. **Automatic Code Splitting**:
   - Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller chunks, reducing the load time for your users.

6. **Image Optimization**:
   - The built-in image component optimizes images on-the-fly, providing better performance and user experience.

7. **File-Based Routing**:
   - Pages are created by adding files to the `pages` directory, simplifying the routing process.

### Getting Started with Next.js

To start a Next.js project, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
